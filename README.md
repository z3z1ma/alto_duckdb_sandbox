# Duckdb + Python Models + Alto playground

A playground for exploring possibilities. We use [alto](https://github.com/z3z1ma/alto) to dynamically derive data inside of python models by leveraging the properties of alto including the fact it encapsulates plugins as PEX files dynamically plumbs up everything you need to pull data just-in-time all whilst maintaining a _tiny_ dependency footprint.
